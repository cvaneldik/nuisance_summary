1. 1_eff_area:

    - Introduction to the problem: what happens if the effective area is wrong
    - Assume a +- 10% energyindependet shift and run the Standarad analysis
    plots:
    - Best Fit Parameters
    - Best Fit Spectrum 
    - Modified eff. area
    
2. 2_implementation:

    - Using the implemented nuisance parameter Fit to fit the same datasets as in 1_eff_area
    plots"
    - Best Fit Parameters comparison with and without the Nuisance Parameters
    - Best Fit Spectrum comparison with and without the Nuisance Parameters
    
    
3. 3_correlation: 

    - Compute the correlation matrix of all the model parameters 
    - and with the nuisance parameters 
    plots:
    both matrices
    
    
4. 4_dependency_on_sigma:

    - Compute for differnent penalty strengths 
    - Not everything clear yet!
    plots:
    best Fit amplitude vs penalty
    
    
5. 5_stat_scan:

    - Stat Scan of Amplitude, Norm and Index for both Standard and Nuisance Fit
    - Example Penalty Scan
    plots:
    three times the Scans
    Penalty scan
    
6. 6_Fluxpoints:

    - Compute FLuxpoints for Standard and Nusiance for factor = 0 
    plots:
    FLuxpoints over Model errorband

    7a: Creation, Fitting, Saving of Possion Draws
    
    7b: Basic Plots
    
    7c: Advanced Plots like Lscan

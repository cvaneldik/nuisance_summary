    - 1_asimov_fitting:
        - Asimov dataset with 100hr of data
        - fitted without nuisance parameters
        - fitted with bias (10 %), piecewise energy (mag = 10%, length = 2), eff. Area (shift = 10 %, tilt = 2 %)
    - 2a-livetime-comparisons
        - fitted datasets with different livetimes (1-100 hr)
        - Asimov with powerlaw
    - 2-livetime-comparison
        - fitted datasets with different livetimes (1-100 hr)
        - Asimov with powerlaw and nuisance parameters, bias (10 %), piecewise energy (mag = 10%, length = 2), eff. Area (shift = 10 %, tilt = 2 %)
